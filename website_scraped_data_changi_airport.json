            "On the non-aeronautical side of the house, the airport lacked commercial offerings that would provide a good retail experience for passengers.

To build air links, the team pursued airline partners by crafting compelling business cases. The efforts yielded fruits. Local carriers agreed to establish their base at DMM while new foreign airlines started to launch flights to DMM.",

Early check-in allows travellers to drop off their baggage and receive their boarding passes ahead of their scheduled departure, starting from 3 to 24 hours before the flight. This service is particularly beneficial for those who want to explore the airport’s amenities or simply avoid the last-minute rush. Unlike regular check-in, which opens about 2 to 3 hours before departure, early check-in provides more flexibility and reduces time spent in queues.",
            "Most airlines operating out of Changi Airport offer the option to check in online, allowing passengers to select their seats and print their boarding passes from the convenience of their home or office. However, there are exceptions, and some smaller or charter airlines might not provide this service. Passengers are advised to check with their respective airlines directly for specific online check-in availability.",
            "To complete online check-in for flights departing from Changi Airport, passengers will need their booking reference or ticket number and the passport details of all travellers.

It’s important to have all necessary documents handy at the time of online check-in to ensure a smooth process.",

            "线上值机时，旅客如有特殊需求或额外请求，可以通过航空公司的网站管理这些偏好。大多数航空公司的网站界面都提供添加额外行李、请求机场协助或做出其他必要安排的选项。如果线上值机平台无法满足特定需求，旅客应直接联系航空公司，确保抵达机场之前一切安排妥当。",

            "完成樟宜机场提前值机后，旅客应先在指定的航空公司柜台放下托运的行李。行李托运后，旅客可直接到安检口，办理出入境手续。完成后，即可体验樟宜机场的众多机场餐馆和离境转机大厅内的人气商品。",
