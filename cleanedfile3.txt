Background: King Fahd International Airport (DMM) located in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, is an important gateway to the countrys Eastern Province. The city is the fourth-most populous in the country and the centre for Saudis oil industry. Changi Airports International (CAI) was engaged by the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) of Saudi Arabia under a nine-year operations and management agreement to transform, commercialise and corporatise DMM. Problem: Back in 2008, DMM faced a serious traffic leak to a competitor airport in a neighbouring country. There was an urgent need to stem traffic outflow, strengthen air links, and reverse the airports declining market share. On the non-aeronautical side of the house, the airport lacked commercial offerings that would provide a good retail experience for passengers. The immediate challenge was to relook the commercial layout and attract a good tenant mix. There was also a need to explore new revenue streams to strengthen the DMMs financial performance. Solutions: The team adopted a multi-pronged approach. It worked with GACA to liberalise aviation policy at DMM to increase the airports appeal. To build air links, the team pursued airline partners by crafting compelling business cases. The efforts yielded fruits. Local carriers agreed to establish their base at DMM while new foreign airlines started to launch flights to DMM. To prepare the airport for the increase in passengers, airport operations were enhanced by injecting capacity, revamping processes and leveraging technology. In 2017, the team launched the Kingdoms very first City Terminal, offering the convenience of off-airport check-in, 24 hours in advance. CAI also strengthened DMMs commercial positioning. The team harnessed usable spaces in DMMs huge terminal to double its commercial area. Tenant mix was enhanced to include many new international brands. New passenger offerings, such as an airport hotel, were introduced. To develop additional revenue streams, the team took advantage of the massive expanse of the airport site to establish a new Cargo Village in 2015. This strategic move not only buttressed DMMs non-aeronautical revenue, it also positioned DMM as an important node in regional trade and enhanced the airports hub status. Results: With holistic hub development and operational efficiency programmes in place, DMM surpassed its competitor as a leading air hub in the region. Its traffic also more than doubled to around 10mppa at the end of CAIs partnership. DMMs non-aeronautical revenue also tripled upon completion of CAIs partnership. Its financial position had turned around. CAI helped transform DMM from a loss-making to an EBITDA-positive airport. In July 2017, DMM was successfully corporatised as Dammam Airports Company (DACO). Related Awards: In 2010, DMM was accorded the Routes Airport Marketing Award (Middle East) at the 8th Routes Asia Conference. In 2015, DMM clinched two accolades at the Airports Council International (ACI) Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Awards: Most Improved Airport (Middle East category) and third place in BestAirport by Region (Middle East category).

Background: Changi Airports International (CAI) was an equity shareholder of Fukuoka International Airport Co., Ltd. (FIAC), the operator of Fukuoka Airport (FUK). FUK is the gateway to Kyushu, a vibrant catchment of 13 million residents in western Japan. FUK is the fourth busiest airport in the country after Narita, Haneda and Kansai airports. Problem: FUK is a highly slots constrained airport. When Covid-19 hit in early 2020, FIAC had to ensure airlines continued to maintain a high level of slots application. This was to position FUK for the strongest possible recovery, and for optimal future growth when the second runway is operationalised in 2025. Additionally, with flights grounded and low passenger volumes, there was a need to pivot to other sources of revenue. Solutions: CAI helped FIAC strategise and implement creative means of traffic development. This included moving airline engagements online, and creating tourism videos of Kyushu in Mandarin to maintain Chinese airlines slots application interests for FUK. On the commercial front, CAI worked with FIAC to introduce three unique, first-in-Japan, airport products. 1. Fukuoka Open Top Bus Tour: Paid service that allows locals and tourists access to the FUK airside on an open top bus. 2. Night Wedding Photo Shoots: Paid service that allows couples to take their wedding photos on the tarmac in front of aircraft, during airport curfew hours. 3. Premium Ground Handling Tour: Paid service that brings children and families to FUKs food catering facility, and FUK airside to learn about ground handling. Results: FUK registered the highest international slots application growth among large Japanese airports during the Covid-19 period, indicating peer outperformance. Post Covid-19, FUKs international passenger traffic recovered the fastest among large Japanese airports. New commercial products helped FIAC grow alternative streams of revenues. New commercial products enabled FIAC to effectively engage the Japanese public even during Covid-19, building goodwill with the community, and positioning FIAC stronger for recovery. Channel NewsAsia reported positively on FUKs new commercial products in September 2023.

Background: Tom Jobim International Airport (GIG) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is the countrys fourth busiest airport pre-Covid, and the main international gateway into the countrys top tourism spots. In November 2013, a CAI-led consortium won the rights to a 25-year concession for the expansion, maintenance and development of the airport. GIG would soon play a critical role in Brazils history, as it welcomed the world in one of the biggest international sporting events: 2016 Summer Olympics (Rio 2016). Problem: There was a slew of challenges to tackle. Aging infrastructure, limited capacity, lagging processes, and a lack of commercial offerings. The task on hand was apparent: To transform GIG into a world-class facility in time for the Olympics and create the finest first impression global visitors would have of Brazil. Solutions: CAI and its Brazilian counterparts introduced operations and service enhancements, including new customer service counters, travellators and escalators, and landscaping, to uplift passenger experience. Airport capacity was boosted with a new 100,000-sqm concourse, 26 contact gates, and additional aircraft stands. A new multi-storey car park was also added for passengers and visitors convenience. Within the terminal, the team reconfigured the layout and passenger flow to smoothen passenger journey and optimise space. The commercial area within the same terminal doubled, and seven new VIP lounges were established. The team also selected a new advertising operator to consolidate and refresh all advertising spaces. To further uncover passengers shopping and dining needs in the airport, the team conducted passenger survey and focus groups. Over 100 new retail and F&B outlets, including specialty shops, were brought in. To up the game, GIG inaugurated an 8,000-sqm walk-through duty-free store, the first in Brazil. Results: The team successfully overhauled GIGs non-aeronautical business. GIG achieved the highest yield per pax among Brazilian airports. It also more than doubled the non-aeronautical revenue per pax within four years of taking over the concession. In August 2016, GIG successfully hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. It handled an unprecedented number of travellers and registered the highest sales in its stores and restaurants. Travellers and media praised GIG, describing the airport journey as seamless and magical. Related Awards: In 2017, GIG was named the Best Airport for Operational Efficiency in Latin America, and Most Punctual Airport in Latin America (10-20 mppa) by OAG Aviation Worldwide. In 2019, GIG was voted the sixth Best Airport in South America by Skytrax.

In October 2022, Changi Airports International (CAI) won a competitive bid issued by Maldives Airport Company Limited (MACL) to provide consultancy services for VIA. Problem: Amid the evolving landscape of air travel, especially in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, MACL faced the imperative task of reassessing its traffic forecast and facility requirements. There were also ongoing projects and new ones such as the Code F runway, seaplane terminal and upcoming international passenger terminal building whichfurther underscored the need for an integrated master plan. MACL had to ensure that these projects aligned seamlessly with its overarching development objectives and do not deviate from the airport's strategic vision. MACL sought to review their existing master plan and airport layout plan to achieve a flexible development plan up to its planned capacity, as well as to provide growth opportunities, address new initiatives and explore options to facilitate the necessary long-term development for VIA. Solutions: A 30-year traffic forecast was done for VIA. Results from the traffic forecast provided the basis for the demand and capacity assessment for the major airport system, which include the airfield (runway, taxiway and parking stands), terminal (domestic, international and sea plane), cargo and landside roadway traffic. Computer simulations have been extensively used in this review to assess the capacity of existing airport infrastructure and identify capacity bottlenecks. Enhancement solutions were also proposed to unlock capacity constraints in order to meet the forecasted traffic demand. CAI also engaged airport stakeholders extensively to explore different expansion proposals before producing the final airport master plan options. Results: The capacity assessment based on simulations provided insights into the congestion points of the existing and future airport system such as the airfield, terminals and roadway. The findings are quantifiable by the Level of Service (LoS), an industry performance benchmark, before and after the capacity improvement proposals.

Remembering our rich past, reinventing ourfuture. Remembering our rich past, reinventing ourfuture. By 1960, Paya Lebar Airport is handling more than 300,000 passengers and 30,000 aircraft movements a year. It welcomes 11 airlines operating 125 weekly flights. Visitor arrivals to Singapore hit 100,000. Over the next two years, the runway at Paya Lebar Airport is extended from 2.4km to 2.7km. This makes it one of the longest runways in Asia. On 1st April 1967, BOAC's Super VC-10, the fastest and most powerful civil jet aircraft of its day, lands at Paya Lebar Airport. Despite the airports growing reputation, the amenities and services at Paya Lebar are still basic and functional. For instance, passengers have to walk up and down mobile steps to embark and disembark their aircraft. Two years later in 1979, the actual construction of Changi Airport begins with the laying of the foundation stone of the Terminal 1 superstructure. On 14 July 1979, SIA and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) sign an agreement to establish air links between the two countries, allowing each airline to operate three flights a week. Even though Changi Airport only officially commenced operations in 1981, we started a series of firsts in the world. We were first to introduce the concept of airport gardens, as well as the first to allow passengers to make free local telephone calls in transit, and more. As an improvement from Paya Lebar Airport, taxi queues were located indoors so passengers were provided with a completely air-conditioned experience from disembarkation to their taxis. On 30 June 1981, the airport moves from Paya Lebar to its new premises at Changi. The following day, Terminal 1 officially becomes operational with the arrival of its first flightSQ101, carrying 140 passengers from Kuala Lumpur at 0700 hrs. The first departing flight, SQ192, leaves for Penang at 0800 hrs on the same day. In just two weeks, 250,000 visitorsor 1 in 10 Singaporeansvisit the airport. Paid tours to the restricted area after immigration are conducted at $0.50 per person. By 1986,Terminal 1 has surpassed the 10 million passenger mark and construction work for Terminal 2 begins. By the early 1990s, Changi is welcoming 52 airlines operating 1,900 weekly flights to 111 cities in 52 countries. Visitor arrivals hit 5.3 million. In 1991, Terminal 2 officially opens to accommodate the ever-growing number of passengers. In the same year, the Changi Airport Skytrains are launched to offer passengers an efficient, comfortable connection between the two terminals. With the dawn of the new millenium, Changi Airport introduces facilities and services catering to a new generation of technology-savvy travellers.

On 1 July 2008, Terminal 3 officially opens. The new terminal features a unique butterfly roof which bathes the terminal building in natural sunlight. Not only does the innovative roof offer passengers a new, relaxing experience, it also creates the environment for the world's first, in-airport Butterfly Garden. The Terminal is now home to more than 1,000 free-roaming butterflies and is a tropical nature retreat. In May 2008, extensive refurbishments to Terminal 1 are completed at a cost of S$500 million. Finally, with the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur route fully liberalised, Singaporean and Malaysian carriers are allowed to operate unlimited flights between the two capitals.

Building for the future to secure Changi Airports position as a leading air hub Building for the future to secure Changi Airports position as a leading air hub Spanning a massive 1,080 hectares, the Changi East development will provide future capacity for Changi Airport. The development will serve to secure Singapores air hub status and ensure its continued competitiveness and relevance. As Changi Airports largest expansion project to date, the development includes: Terminal 5 is a project undertaken by Changi Airport Group, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, and the Ministry of Transport. T5 will be linked to the other terminals at Changi Airport, allowing the expanded Changi Airport to be operated as a single, integrated airport for ease of transfer between different terminals with airfield operational efficiency. New facilities, such as navigation aids, airfield lighting systems and a fire station will also be constructed. The existing third runway, previously used only by the military, has been extended from 2.75km to 4km to handle larger passenger aircraft, and converted for joint military-civilian use.Under the three-runway programme, almost 40km of new taxiways will also be built to connect the runway with the rest of Changi Airport. This three-runway system is scheduled for operationalisation by the mid-2020s. Changi Airports cargo facilities, currently located at the Changi Airfreight Centre, will be expanded to the Changi East Industrial Zone (CEIZ) as part of the Changi East Development.The zone will be developed for airfreight, air express and Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO) activities. Together with the remodelled Changi Airfreight Centre, Changis handling capabilities will increase from 3 million tonnes per annum today, to 5.4 million tonnes per annum in its end-state, when the project is completed. The future expanded air cargo hub will be smarter, more connected and more efficient. The use of data and technology with a focus on automation will reduce processing time, and improve productivity and cargo visibility.Strategic infrastructure planning will ensure greater operational efficiency, with dedicated lanes for autonomous guided vehicles. Direct access to freighter aircraft from cargo and express terminals will also speed up cargo flows.With environmental and workplace sustainability in mind, the new air cargo hub will feature eco-friendly handling equipment, convenient amenities and a land transport network for staff. Terminal 5 (T5) will be located within the 1,080-hectare Changi East development, and will be able to handle about 50 million passenger movements per year. T5 will be designed with the flexibility to be built in two phases, in line with traffic growth, and is expected to be operational around the mid-2030s. It will secure Singapores capacity to ride on the long-term growth of aviation, strengthening Changi Airports position as a premier air hub for the region and beyond, and ensuring that future generations of Singaporeans can continue to benefit from Changis global connectivity. T5 will reinforce Changi Airports status as a national icon and ensure that the airport will continue to be a place of shared experiences across generations of Singaporeans, where precious memories are forged with friends and family. Drawing on lessons learnt from the Covid-19 pandemic, T5 has been designed with the flexibility to operate as smaller sub-terminals when needed. Specialised provisions to reduce the transmission of diseases will also be deployed in T5, including contactless systems at passenger touchpoints and enhanced ventilation systems. T5 will be a Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy Building, as certified by the Building and Construction Authority. To reduce its carbon footprint, solar panels; smart building management systems; and district cooling combined with thermal energy storage will be deployed. T5 will also be ready for environmentally friendly solutions such as providing fixed ground power and cooling, as well as viable alternative fuels including the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel for aircraft. T5 will be designed to accommodate and facilitate the deployment of technology, such as autonomous vehicles and baggage handling robots, to automate and digitalise airport operations, to enhance the passenger experience and increase manpower productivity. This will provide local enterprises with an opportunity to build capabilities in new, emerging areas such as robotics and artificial intelligence, and ultimately create quality jobs for Singaporeans within the airport ecosystem. For more information about T5, please refer to CAGs factsheet. Watch Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong share about T5 in his 2022 National Day Rally. The Changi 2036 Steering Committee, which was established to develop a holistic long-term plan for the expansion of Changi Airport, announces its recommendations to construct Terminal 5 (T5) and implement a three-runway system at Changi. Land preparation works for Changi East and planning for T5 begin, including functional design studies and concept development for the terminal. CAG launches the first of several packages of works to put in place the three-runway system. The works include pavement works, drainage works, security fencing and perimeter roads, mechanical and electrical works, as well as supporting works, such as major services and road diversions. CAG announces the appointment of the Master Building Consultants (MBC), to provide architectural design and engineering consultancy services for the development of T5. The Master Civil Consultants (MCC) are also appointed, to provide consultancy services for the design of infrastructure at the landside and airside areas outside of the T5 buildings. A two-year pause of the T5 project is announced, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The aim is to assess the impact of Covid-19 on aviation growth, learn from the pandemic experience, and review T5s design to meet the needs of post-pandemic travel. The resumption of work on the T5 project is announced. MOT, CAAS and CAG have taken the opportunity of the two-year pause to comprehensively review the T5 design to make it more modular, resilient and sustainable. Construction of T5 will commence in about two years for T5 to meet the anticipated demand for air travel around the mid-2030s.

Turn on your notifications and let Changi App keep you updated on the status of your bag(s)! Enjoy a worry-free trip as we track your bags and keep you posted. If your flight is departing from Changi Airport, you will be able to track your bags from the time you check-in for your flight, up till the point your bags are loaded into the aircraft. If your flight is arriving at Changi Airport, you will be able to track your bags from the time you check-in for your flight at your flight's departing airport, up till the point your bags are delivered to the baggage claim belt at Changi Airport.* Do note that the arrival tracking feature is only available at Terminals 2, 3 and 4 for now. We are working to bring this feature to flights arriving at Terminal 1 very soon. If you have an onward connecting flight at Changi Airport,you will be able to track your bags at the following touchpoints, if the airlines you are flying with are participating in our baggage tracker service: Scan the QR code or click on the link below with your mobile device. The baggage tracker is a trial service by Changi Airport Group (CAG) to provide departing, arriving and transferring passengers with status updates of their bags as they travel through Changi Airport. When you check-in for your flight, you will receive a baggage tag stub, which will have a barcode containing your bag tag number. Bag tag numbers are between 8 and 12 characters. E.g. 10000123456, AB123456, CD98765432. Scan the barcode or type in the number into the baggage tracker service using your Changi App, and you are good to go! Your airline(s) likely are not participating in the trial at this point. If you believe that this is an error, please email enquiry@changiairport.com, or fill up the survey link found at the bottom of your bag tracker card. We are continually working with our airline partners at Changi Airport to bring as many airlines onboard as possible. Most checked-in bags will be tracked, with the exception of odd-sized bags, gate-checked bags and limited release tagged bags. Bags that need to be connected between flights, in particular those with short connecting times (e.g. due to delayed inbound flights) and bags on One-Stop Security transfer flights, may not be tracked. Up to 3 days. Yes, it's the same service and the information is largely similar, with some differences - your airline may provide you with additional information only available to them, while the Changi App Baggage Tracker may have more information displayed that is integrated with our airport facilities. The Changi App Baggage Tracker uses a combination of information provided by the airline you travel with and Changi Airports baggage system to provide you with a journey of your bags through Changi Airport. We are upgrading our arrival baggage tracking systems at Terminal 1, and hope to be able to extend this service to Terminal 1 in the near future. This means that the bags that you have checked in have been placed into containers/trolleys bound for your departing flight. Bags may be loaded at any time before the flight departs and notifications may be delayed. If you are arriving at Changi Airport and are unable to find your bag on the arrival belt, please proceed to the Lost & Found counter for more information and assistance. If you are not on an interline ticket and instead have purchased two tickets to your final destination separately, you may need to collect your bags at the arrival belt and check-in again for your departing flight at Changi Airport. We recommend that you check with the transfer counter at Changi Airport on whether your bags have been checked through to your final destination. If your flight is arriving at Changi Airport, please proceed to the arrival claim belt after disembarking from the flight to see if your bag has arrived. If the last bag notification is displayed on the TV screens at the baggage claim area, and your bags have not arrived, please proceed to the Lost & Found counters for further assistance. No, this feature is only available via the Changi App. Please email enquiry@changiairport.com, or fill up the survey link found at the bottom of your bag tracker card. *Unavailable for departure tracking.T1 arrival tracking will be made available in the near future *Unavailable for departure tracking.^Unavailable for arrival tracking. *Unavailable for departure tracking.
